# Supernatural Jam 2020

## Intro

**Hello guys and gals and non-binary pals!** We participated in the 1st ever [Supernatural Jam](https://itch.io/jam/supernatural-jam), a charity game jam which directly supports [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/). Let's talk about it.

(If you're excited to see everyone's wonderful creations, skip to the **Submissions** section)

Together, we raised **$235.30** for The Trevor Project! Here's how that money was raised:
1. For every submission, no matter how "good" or complete, I donated **$5** (up to $2,000)
2. During that weekend of livestreams, all monetary interactions were donated without restriction:
	3. 1 bit = **1Â¢**
	4. 1 sub = **$5**
	5. 1 donation = **full amount**

The turnout was phenomenal! I'm super proud of everyone who participated, even indirectly. You're all incredible ðŸ’œ

> The goal of the game is to make money by creating sites. This game is a "clicker game", but with the specificity that it is not a clicker game but a "typing game".

> This was meant to be an infinite runner, you're a werewolf that has decided to take out all that full moon energy on running from building to building without falling down. Because if you do, you'll be too tempted to kill people.
